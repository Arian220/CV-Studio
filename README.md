# CV Studio

CV Studio is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool designed for image annotation and labeling. It allows users to easily annotate images by drawing bounding boxes or polygons and associate labels with them. The software supports different output formats, such as YOLO and COCO, and provides zooming features for better interaction with the images. It is especially useful for training machine learning models with labeled datasets.

## Features

- **Image Loading**: Load multiple images from a directory for annotation.
- **Bounding Box and Polygon Annotation**: Draw bounding boxes and polygons to annotate objects in images.
- **Class Management**: Add, remove, and load classes for annotation.
- **Zooming**: Zoom in and out of images to make detailed annotations.
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Export annotations in YOLO or COCO format.
- **File Management**: Open and save images, load and save annotation classes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed using PyQt5 for a modern and responsive interface.
